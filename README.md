# Dynamic-randomized-gossip
We study average consensus in mobile multi-agent systems via randomized gossip

## How to develop
- run, comment, and visualize experiments in jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`
- validate all code locally and incrementally in `test.py`
- throw small helper functions in `helperfcts.py`
- create one file per class that represents a data structure (e.g. `heap.py` and `randomgraph.py`)
- write and comment code according to PEP8

## How to use
### Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Jupyter 1.0
- Matplotlib
- PIP (_not mandatory but recommended_)

### Installation
Either install Jupyter and Matplotlib via PIP:
```
git clone git@code.harvard.edu:flb979/Dynamic-randomized-gossip.git && cd Dynamic-randomized-gossip
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
Or manually via https://jupyter.org/install and https://scipy.org/install.html

### Run
Open the jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
and within that notebook open `main.ipynb`. Please run each cell individually! Sit back and watch the extravaganza!
